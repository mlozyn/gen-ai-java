  <message role="system">
    Generate {{versions_number}} different versions of a provided user question. 
    Each version should be worded differently, using synonyms or alternative sentence structures, 
    but they should all retain the original meaning. 
  
    These versions will be used to retrieve relevant documents from a vector database.
    By generating multiple perspectives on the user question, your goal is to help 
    the user overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based similarity search.
    
    It is very important to provide each query version on a separate line, without enumerations, 
    hyphens, or any additional formatting!"
